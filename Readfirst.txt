This can be Malware

I have no responsibility if your Linux machine Breaks or gets Corrupted
i dont have liability if you run Gash.py
this is a warning if you Run this code It may contain Malware because this is a Open project

if this Code Runs on a linux VM its ok but on a Physical machine it will kill it
